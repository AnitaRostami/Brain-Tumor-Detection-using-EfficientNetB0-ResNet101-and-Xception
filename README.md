# Brain Tumor Detection using EfficientNetB0, ResNet101, and Xception

We explore advanced deep learning techniques for detecting brain tumors in this notebook using three powerful pre-trained models: EfficientNetB0, ResNet101, and xception. Leveraging transfer learning, we want to increase classification accuracy on a small dataset by using the rich feature representations learned from large-scale datasets. This approach helps in overcoming the challenges of limited data, ensuring robust and efficient tumor detection.

We start by preprocessing the data, then fine-tune each pre-trained model. Performance data and visualizations are provided to help analyze and compare the efficacy of each model. 

This notebook uses a dataset with four classes, glioma_tumor, no_tumor, meningioma_tumor, and pituitary_tumor, supplied from Kaggle: [Brain Tumor Classification (MRI)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sartajbhuvaji/brain-tumor-classification-mri).

### Tumor Types: 
- **Glioma Tumor:** Originates in glial cells, often malignant, causing seizures and cognitive impairments.
- **Meningioma Tumor:** Forms in the meninges, grows slowly, but can cause seizures and eye problems.
- **Pituitary Tumor:** Mostly benign, occurring in the pituitary gland, leading to hormonal imbalances and vision changes.
